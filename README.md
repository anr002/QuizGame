# Smite Quiz Game

## Overview
This project is all about combining my passion for gaming with my love for coding. I've created a fun and interactive quiz game based on one of my favorite games, Smite. The game tests your knowledge about the various gods in Smite, their abilities, and more. I've used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend, and Python for the backend to scrape data and images from the Smite Wiki.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Quiz Game**: Test your knowledge about the gods in Smite. Each question presents an ability icon, and you have to guess which god it belongs to.
- **Variety of Topics**: Although the game currently focuses on Smite, I plan to expand it to cover a variety of topics.
- **Difficulty Levels**: The game will feature different difficulty levels to cater to both new and experienced players.
- **Web Scraping Tools**: I've developed Python scripts to scrape data and images from the Smite Wiki, which are then used to generate the quiz questions.

## Technologies Used
- `HTML`: For structuring the web pages.
- `CSS`: For styling the web pages.
- `Bootstrap`: For responsive design and prebuilt components.
- `Python`: For backend logic and web scraping.
- `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`: To retrieve and parse data from the Smite Wiki.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: Python scripts scrape data and images from the Smite Wiki.
2. **Quiz Generation**: The scraped data is used to generate quiz questions. Each question presents an ability icon, and you have to guess which god it belongs to.
3. **Interactive Gameplay**: Players interact with the game through a user-friendly web interface. After each question, the game provides immediate feedback and updates the score.

## Personal Touch
This project is a reflection of my personal interests and my skills as a developer. It's been a fun and rewarding experience to combine my love for gaming with my passion for coding. I hope you enjoy playing the game as much as I enjoyed creating it!

## Future Enhancements
I plan to expand the game to cover a variety of topics and add different difficulty levels. I'm also considering adding a multiplayer mode where players can compete against each other in real-time. Stay tuned for updates!
